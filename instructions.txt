This program depends on the python module PyPDF2 version 1.7, available for download and installation at:
https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/

This program will collate a PDF file (or the PDF files in a directory) scanned using an auto-document feeder without cutting the binding of the original document. 


A potential 4-page PDF input document
    -----------------
    |   8   |   1   |   (Page 1)
    -----------------
    |   2   |   7   |   (Page 2)
    -----------------
    |   6   |   3   |   (Page 3)
    -----------------
    |   4   |   5   |   (Page 4)
    -----------------

Will be collated into the resulting document:
    ---------
    |   1   |   (Page 1)
    ---------
    |   2   |   (Page 2)
    ---------
    |   3   |   (Page 3)
    ---------
    |   4   |   (Page 4)
    ---------
    |   5   |   (Page 5)
    ---------
    |   6   |   (Page 6)
    ---------

To prepare a document for use:
-Remove the document's fasteners
-Open to its center page 
-Placed in the auto-document feeder (ADF).
-The resulting scan should begin with the first and last page of the original pamphlet, with each subsequent page in the document moving towards the middle pages of the original pamphlet.
-Crop as needed.
